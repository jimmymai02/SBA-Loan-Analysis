# SBA-Loan-Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into whether an SBA loan should be approved or denied based on the provided SBA loan data (industry of the business, the size of the loan, amount of the loan that is guaranteed, etc.).

Small business owners often seek out SBA (Small Business Association) loans because they guarantee part of the loan. SBA will cover some of the losses should the business default on the loan, which lowers the risk involved for the business owner(s). The SBA will play a particularly important role in small business success now with the COVID-19 pandemic which is impacting many small businesses around the world, crippling most of them.

### Dataset Description
The dataset is from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) The U.S. SBA was founded in 1953 on the principle of promoting and assisting small enterprises in the U.S. credit market (SBA Overview and History, US Small Business Administration (2015)). Small businesses have been a primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment. There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such as FedEx and Apple Computer. However, there have also been stories of small businesses and/or start-ups that have defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans.
